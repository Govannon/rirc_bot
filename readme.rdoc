# rIRC bot

Simple irc bot that will read input from text files and outputs that on irc.

## First-time use:

  ruby ./irc.rb

This will detect a missing config.yml and guide you through an interactive configuration. After this, it will connect. use ctrl-c to disconnect.

## Daemonize

  ./daemon (start|stop|restart)

This uses the daemons gem. A pid file is stored in log/, as well as a log file.
